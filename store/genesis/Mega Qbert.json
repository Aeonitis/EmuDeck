  "description": "Mega Q*bert is a new game for Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis. Featured are 2 different game modes. Mega mode contains 80 levels to beat, often filled with new irregular blocks that make things harder and more complex enemies, while Arcade mode is a recreation of original arcade game (based on the NES iteration, to be more exact). Both modes offer simultaneous cooperative gameplay.",
