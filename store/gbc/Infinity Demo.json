  "description": "Infinity is a role-playing game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console, developed by Affinix Software primarily between the years 1999 and 2001. The game is incomplete and should be considered alpha/preview quality. In 2021, development on the game resumed and will hopefully see a commercial release soon.",
